# Blood_Bank_Management

Proposed Solution: 
 The primary goal of our project is to provide blood management and donation 
services online. The Blood Bank Management System is a Web-based application program 
that stores, processes, retrieves, and analyses data related to administrative and inventory 
management in a blood bank. This project intends to keep track of all information about 
blood donors and the various blood groups accessible in blood banks, as well as to assist 
them in better managing their operations.
Who can be benefitted by this: 
 People who are in urgent need of blood, hospital patients, those who are unable 
to physically access blood bank immediately are benefitted by this application
Expected output: 
 The proposed application (Blood Bank Management System) is intended to help 
the blood donation center’s executive to satisfy the requests of people in need of blood by 
sending and additionally serving the demands for blood as and when required. The proposed 
application gives the solution to overcome any issues between Recipient, Donor and Blood 
Bank. This project will give a shared platform for every one of the three groups (Beneficiary, 
Donor, and Blood Bank). The following are the outcomes our project.
Outcomes:
●To facilitate the process of blood donation.
●To work on enhancing the existing system.
●To be easily accessible.
